Not all applications of Echo depend on pseudorandom numbers. Where they do not,
their construction can ensure that only unique 1-byte values are used.until
these are exhausted.

In the course of the GENERIC-SHORT-ECHO changes, this has been made more
precise using the concept of "authority over synchronized property" introduced there.

Item 3 of appendix A can be as short as 1 byte (until it overflows to 2), with
a concrete example linked, and includes a requirement for its applicability.

For example, method 3 (persistent counter) notes that it can be used for state synchronization but not client aliveness

These are now tied together by the Characterization chapter introduced in
GENERIC-SHORT-ECHO.

They are Echo values sent with successful responses. The term is defined now at
first use, and one more place where it could have been used added now that it's
introduced properly.

This spectrum, with the axes kind-of-freshness and authority-over-synchronized-property, is now
described in a new Characterization of Echo Applications subsection, which
includes limited-time-single-use as a combined form of kind-of-freshness.

(also addresses Roman's "helpful to explicitly state")

State synchronization is indeed something that can be done with freshness; text
was tweaked to make that more visible. It's still mentioned often together
with freshness, as it is a very important class of use cases. That the state is
not carried inside the Echo option is now emphasised in the applications list.

On the topic of authority, this is now covered in the characterization of Echo
applications (see also GENERIC-SHORT-ECHO).

Under the threat model of pearg-numeric-ids-generation, relevant identifiers
are outer Request-Tag and outer Echo values of OSCORE (as inner and DTLS
protected ones are protected by message integrity, and Token rules are only
updated for DTLS where it is protected as well).

For the remaining cases, a paragraph has been added to the privacy
considerations section.

Such a comparison was attempted, but found to be tied too deeply into
core-coap-attacks; an issue has been opened at
https://github.com/EricssonResearch/coap-actuators/issues/8.

That comment did inspire a paragraph on the relationship between Request-Tag
and replay protection, which did get more interesting when the document was
adapted in awareness of DTLS's option to not use replay protection at all.

> Section 2.3

If the client does not increment the token, it would be susceptible to the 4.01
response being reinjected, so it may try again -- but as it is not incrementing
tokens, the server processes the request only once anyway (but the client is
left ignorant of its success).

So yes there are some light implications (and more severe ones in corner
cases), but the trouble from token reuse is so much bigger than this one case
that pointing it out specifically would probably distract more than help.

Good term, taken.

It does meet the particular requirement of the above paragraph ("different
except with negligible probability") as it is just counting up (where after 255
events it'd overflow to two bytes and further).

For the general requirements, these should now be clearer (see
GENERIC-SHORT-ECHO).

That's what it should have said in the first place; fixed.

That was indeed missing; the "they SHOULD respond with" was intended to leave
room for other methods of obtaining freshness, not to just ignore the issue and
respond to the Echo challenge unchecked. A "MUST NOT repeat an unsafe request
and [SHOULD]" was added.

(The exception for safe methods allows filling caches, similar to how item 3.1
of the Applications of the Echo Option section describes CoAP-CoAP proxies that
forward to their client interface though they reject on their server
interface).

The "authority over synchronized property" concept intoduced in response to the toplevel comment
(GENERIC-SHORT-ECHO) covers most of this. Thus, also the time synchronization
given can be valid here -- provided the client is a recognize authority
for it. Which, in a group case, it will likely not be; thus, removing the
example from there. (Also upgrading the "see" to an "as specified" to softly
indicate that this is not done easily).

It kind of makes sense, but (with the current terminology) would really need
terminology introduction. This particular occurrence has been cleared up in
unrelated edits already; the later is changed.

Different strategies are valid here, and to be honest it may need some
additional deployment experience to give hard and fast criteria here.

The distinction only starts to matter when an attacker finds a potential
amplification helper that already is in legitimate contact with its victim.
Picking "the endpoint" as peer definition (which is host and port on both
sides, plus the security association), as that curbs the attack at least in the
case in which the amplification-helper-to-be does the OSCORE itself, and will
then be suspicious of unprotected requests for large responses from the
attacker.

There is some wiggle room in the interpretation of endpoint, especially in
layered setups (I like to think of a CoAP library as a proxy that translates
CoAP-over-API to CoAP-over-transport), and some room for optimization (if the
unsecured endpoint is good, no need to check for reachability of the secured
equivalent), but that at last *will* need the deployment experience to be
gathered over the next months and years to see what is practical.

Indeed. Realizing that DTLS can be used with replay protection off made this
half-sentence go away and caused some follow-up adaptions.

Section 2.4 is where the cited suggestion is made. This is the relevant
reference because there it is made clear that "the resource" to which block
operations are keyed is the cache key and not the URI.

Section 2.5 explains the general Block1 phase behavior. Its last paragraph is
on concurrent transfers, but does not add anything to the understanding of
Request-Tag, whereas the 2.4 statements contain the justification for why this
can work that way (which applies to Block1 and Block2 alike).

This could precisely this could say "if the client can recycle the request tag"
-- but that has not been introduced at this point, and more importantly the
paragraph is about server behavior (examplifying how "equal request tags"
doesn't necessarily mean "same operation").

"MUST consider messages matchable if they were sent to..." makes this clearer
now.

With the DTLS replay window realization, this would have become unwieldly, and
thus was simplified to the "when the client knows the server won't accept it"
that was already there. What that means in practice is spelled out for OSCORE
and DTLS in the following paragraphs anyway.

The point about retransmission is on CoAP here; made more explicit in the
rephrasing.

The line was also changed to include the necessity for the server to perform
replay protection (which until the RD review I was unaware was even optional).
The over-all statement (which leaves the door open for request tag recycling in
DTLS) is left open, even though this new constraint is making it *even* harder
to be sure -- but the situations in which that could previously done were
already pretty niche, and in a setup where the application can alreay know what
got ACKed and what got retransmitted, it is not out of the question that it
knows the server well enough to assert that it has replay protection active as
well.

The behavior is the whole subsection's. (Many such specifications WOULD
PROBABLY also mandate a particular security mechanism, narrowing it down to one
of the cases, but the intention is to use the abstract behavior)

Now clarified, and nit taken.

The order of CoAP options is significant in the information model (and if any
doubt on this arises, core-corr-clar would be the place to to dispell them).

As Request-Tag has no own semantics, intermediaries can put theirs in the front
or back (or not use repeatability at all), but as implementers can pick any, I
don't see much to point out.

Enforcing that means that not only state about ongoing block-wise operations is
kept (which is about as much state as can be tolerated), but that in addition
also state about block-wise transfers that are not pursued any more would need
to be kept -- and that's too much to ask (as it'd be per-client times
per-resource information).

Changed to refer to HTTP/1.1. Covering what /2 and /3 do might be interesting
comparison material, but given we're just tweaking the Token mechanism here
(and not introducing it anew, which would warrant the detailed related-work
comparison over the setting-the-mental-frame reference to HTTP/1.1), that
should suffice.

These recommendations are for secured transports without request-response
binding, i.e. DTLS. As the identifiers are protected by the DTLS integrity
protection, they are outside the scope of the threat model described in
numeric-ids-generation. (On the other hand, the nontrivial, randomized token
recommended for non-TLS cases, and this document makes no updates for them.)

The concepts of numeric-ids did result in additions to the privacy
considerations for outer Echo and Request-Tag values.

There is one -- demonstrating network reachability. It's not a common case
(often the large responses are from GETs that don't need freshness anyway), but
educational in the sense that it helps fill the continuum between
MAC-the-address (RECOMMENDED for reachability) and time-and-MAC-of-time
(RECOMMENDED for freshness) to guide the reader towards understanding the whole
and not just coding down the recipes. Added.

The additions of GENERIC-SHORT-ECHO, especially on "authority over synchronized property", should
help in describing this and limiting any ill-effects.

If the client is *not* trusted, we're fast into the order of magnitude of
64-bit MACs; anything less might just give a false sense of security. Where
these are transported regularly (as in [RD]), that quickly adds up in total
bytes on the air. Thes cases *do* need good analysis, and it is hoped that with
the new text the tools for this are there, but when the result is that trusting
the client on this freshness is fine, then a counter should be too and has the
least cost.

> There are several SHOULDs (e.g., near the top of page 8, and again at the end of Section 2.3) that left me wondering why an implementer would do something other than what it says.  Since SHOULD offers a choice, some advice would be helpful here.  Otherwise, maybe those ought to be MUSTs.  I suggest giving them all a once-over to see if any such advice would be helpful to include.

Some categories of SHOULDs were identified that did not warrant any additions:

* "You can do it differently and it wouldn't be wrong just weird (but maybe you
  have good reasons we don't understand)": eg. 'MUST NOT process [...] further
  and SHOULD send a 4.01 Unauthorized'. If the application has a successful
  code in a content format that indicates "try again with whatever I'm
  providing you here", that's technically fine and won't break things (which'd
  justify a MUST). But it's not like we can give good reasons to do that other
  than "someone decided to do it differently in that API", so there's nothing
  good to say.

* "If you have anything better, be my guest": In some places, there is no
  current alternative but no reason to rule them out either. It's unlikely
  there'll be an "Echo 2.0" that does the same just different, but a more
  complex mechanism that provides freshness as bycatch would be a viable option
  in some places.

For others (eg. SHOULD use preemptive values, pointing to privacy
considerations), options were given; one SHOULD is indeed a MUST (HTTP-to-CoAP
proxies) as there's no other viable option.

The name needs to work well both for the use in the request and in the
response; "Echo" works for both (in the imperative mood in the request, and the
indicative mood in the response).

The overlap with the ICMP Echo mechanism was not originally intended, but the
*are* parallels not only in word but also in semantics ("show that you are
there by sending back to me what I send you"), so they are somewhat fitting --
and in the protocol stack it's far enough from ICMP that actual mixups are
considered unlikely.

> I would have expected some statements related to non-idempotent requests (generic statement) and then specific examples such as actuators.

Nothing about Echo needs to distinguish between idempotent and non-idempotent
requests. (There was one mention, but that should have said "safe").

If anything, there could be a distinction between safe and non-safe requests,
because the former can't realistically have freshness requirements. But as some
of the state synchronization uses don't look at the request but more general
properties of the endpoint (like the replay window recovery), making statements
in that direction would likely cause more confusion than clarity.

As you give two example methods in the draft, why not reserve a few extra bits to specify which method is in use?  This would also allow you to drop the necessary callback routines in libraries.

## Brought up by multiple reviewers

### GENERIC-SHORT-ECHO

The explanations as to the required properties of Echo values were
inconsistent: Section 2.3 "Echo Processing" required that the server MUST be
able to verify that the Echo value is genuine, but at the same time the
permitted minimal length and the example in Appendix A item 3 indicated that
this would not always be the case.

In parallel, Ben Kaduk's review asked for elaboration on the spectrum of
requirements -- of which some extremes call for verifiable Echo values, and
others not.

Consequently, a section "Characterization of Echo Applications" was added that
discusses three aspects: "authority over synchronized property", "Time vs. Events" and "applicable security protocools". In the former,
we derive when using guessable Echo values is OK, and when not.

In the remaining texts, the ambiguous points were clarified (often pointing
at the new distinctions). In particular, the security considerations used to
conflate the topic of "authority over synchronized property" with the Counter implementation --
while these generally do coincide, the new text is more precise and refers
back to the new section.
